/**
 * Flat ESLint config (CON-39).
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. `tsc` already covers types; this only adds what it
 * cannot see — hook order and effect dependencies, the bug classes behind
 * CON-35/CON-36/CON-37 (relay reconnect, `want()` refcounting, subscription
 * resubscribe races). Plus whatever `js.configs.recommended` catches for free.
 *
 * The React-Compiler-era rules that ship with eslint-plugin-react-hooks 7
 * (`set-state-in-effect`, `immutability`, `refs`, …) are deliberately *not*
 * enabled through its preset: this app subscribes to external stores and is
 * built around `useSyncExternalStore`, which those rules flag by design.
 * Turning them on wholesale would bury the two rules that matter here. If we
 * want one of them, add it individually with the findings fixed.
