# Notes for AI agents working in this repo

Project: a Confluence-like wiki on Nostr. The full design lives in
[`docs/`](docs/README.md) — that is where the reasoning behind every decision
is. This file only contains working rules.

## Always manage groups with `nak group`

**Rule:** NIP-29 groups are created and modified exclusively through
`nak group` — `create-group`, `edit-metadata`, `put-user`, `remove-user`,
`create-invite`, `delete-event`. Never sign and publish the relay-generated
events `39000`, `39001`, `39002`, `39003` yourself.

**Why:** with NIP-29 the relay is the authority. Self-signed metadata events are
a stand-in: they look right in the client, but the relay enforces nothing,
membership and roles are fiction, and behavioural differences from a real relay
surface late.

**Consequence:** a relay that really implements NIP-29 has to be running.
`nak serve` does not (its NIP-11 lists no NIP 29, and `9007`/`9000` are only
stored raw). Therefore:

```bash
./scripts/dev-relay-up.sh     # verse-pbc/groups_relay on :8080 (natively via cargo)
./scripts/dev-group-seed.sh   # group and members via nak group
```

The build runs natively through cargo because the bundled `Dockerfile.dev` fails
at `cargo build --features console`. Without Rust the script falls back to
Docker with the production Dockerfile.

`nak serve` is only admissible for work without Docker and without group logic
(for example pure event-format checks) — and then without faked group metadata.

`nak group` is a **client**, not a relay: it does not replace a running relay.

## Addressing groups with nak

`nak group <command> <address>` accepts two forms:

- NIP-AD web address `host/group` — resolved via
  `https://<host>/.well-known/nostr.json`, so it does **not** work against
  `localhost` without TLS.
- `naddr1…` — always works:
  `nak encode naddr -d <group> -k 39000 -a <relay-pubkey> -r <relay-url>`

The relay pubkey comes from the NIP-11 document (`nak relay <url>`, field `self`
or `pubkey`).

## nak against `groups_relay`: which flags when

Measured on 2026-09-07. Without these rules commands come back empty or hang:

| Call | Flags | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `nak req`, reading in general | `--fpa --sec <key>` | For private groups the relay **silently** filters out unauthenticated readers instead of rejecting with `auth-required`. `--auth` only reacts to a rejection and therefore never fires; `--fpa` (force-pre-auth) waits for the challenge |
| `nak event` (publishing) | `--fpa --sec <key>` | Works; `--auth` alone is often enough, `--fpa` is more reliable |
| `nak group create-group` | **only** `--sec` | With `--fpa` the command hangs: it reads metadata before publishing and waits there for a challenge that never arrives on that path |
| `nak group put-user` | `--fpa --sec` | Works |
| `nak group info`, `members`, `edit-metadata` | — | **Unusable against this relay.** They call `fetchGroupMetadata` through nak's internal pool, which knows no AUTH; `info` hangs forever. Check state with `nak req -k 39000 -k 39001 -k 39002` instead |

Two substantive consequences:

- **Opening a group needs a raw `9002`.** The relay creates groups as `private`
  + `closed`. `nak group edit-metadata` omits the `public` and `open` tags when
  those flags are false — but `apply_tags` in the relay is additive and only
  changes what is present as a tag. `private` could therefore never be cleared.
  Hence one
  `nak event -k 9002 -h <group> -t public= -t open= …`. That is still the
  intended NIP-29 path (a moderation event the relay evaluates) and **not** a
  self-signed `39000`.
- **Kind 0 is rejected.** A real NIP-29 relay requires an `h` tag on every
  event; profiles belong on the user's own relays (`VITE_PROFILE_RELAYS`).
  Locally the app therefore shows npubs instead of names.

## Ports on this machine

| Purpose | Port | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| App (Vite) | 5273 | 5173 is taken by a container |
| NIP-29 relay | 8080 | — |
| `nak serve` (emergencies only) | 10577 | 10547 is taken by a relay container |
| Blossom dev server | 3355 | — |

## Small things that cost time

- **zsh:** `GID` is a reserved variable. `GID=engineering` fails with "failed to
  change group ID". Use `GROUP_ID` in scripts.
- **Every** nak call in a script needs `</dev/null` — including
  `nak key public`. Otherwise they block on stdin when the script runs from a
  pipe. `nak event` without `-c` waits on stdin as well.
- nak exits with 1 for expected states (for example "Group already exists").
  With `set -e` a script dies silently at that point — add `|| true` and check
  the output yourself.
- Ephemeral events (20000–29999) are rejected by `nak serve` with
  `mute: no one was listening for this` when nobody has subscribed. That is not
  a permission problem.

## Traps in the Nostr layer

- **Do not overwrite `relay.onclose`.** `SimplePool.ensureRelay` installs its
  own handler there which removes the dead connection from the registry.
  Replacing it means the next `ensureRelay` hands back the same dead object.
  Chain onto it instead of replacing it.
- **Subscriptions die with their connection.** After a reconnect or a signer
  change (AUTH is per connection) all subscriptions have to be set up again. The
  client counts an `epoch` per relay for exactly this.
- **`pool.get` has no `onauth` hook.** On a relay with enforced NIP-42 it
  silently returns empty results. Read through `subscribeEose` with `onauth`.
- **`subscribeEose` closes on EOSE.** That is too early for the echo of an
  ephemeral event — use `pool.subscribe` there.
- **`useSyncExternalStore` needs a memoised `subscribe` function.** A new
  function identity per render resubscribes; if the store starts something while
  doing so, the loop never ends.
- **Key every internal map by nostr-tools' own normalised url, not by the
  app's string.** `normalizeURL()` (from `nostr-tools/utils`, also used
  internally by `SimplePool`) appends a trailing slash:
  `ws://localhost:8080` becomes `ws://localhost:8080/`. `NostrClient` used
  to keep two sets of books — `refreshAuth` looked the connection up with the
  app's unnormalised string, `listConnectionStatus()` knew it only under the
  normalised one, so the lookup missed and the function returned early *every
  time*: AUTH never reached `'ok'`. Meanwhile `pool.automaticallyAuth`
  called `signAuth` with the normalised url and wrote `'pending'` into a
  second snapshot nothing ever rendered. Fixed with `NostrClient.key()`
  (wrapping `normalizeURL`, with a try/catch fallback) that `wanted`,
  `snapshots` and the rest are addressed through; `getSnapshot`/`patch`
  normalise on the way in, so `RelaySnapshot.url` is normalised too —
  `RelayStatusBadge`'s `hostOf()` strips the trailing slash back out for
  display. Found 2026-09-11 auditing CON-35.
- **A relay's rejection of a pending operation does not mean that operation
  actually failed.** `AbstractRelay.close()` rejects every open publish with
  `Error("relay connection closed by us")` — including a pending
  `relay.auth(sign)` from a `refreshAuth` call started on the *previous*
  connection and not yet settled when `NostrClient` intentionally closed it
  to reconnect (e.g. on `setSigner`). Reading that rejection at face value
  and patching `auth: 'failed'` reports an AUTH failure that never happened.
  Found 2026-09-11 as a second cause behind CON-35: logging out alone (no
  second `setSigner` call, no race with a later `open()`) could flip the
  relay indicator red this way, because the last read/publish before logout
  often still has a `refreshAuth` in flight. Fixed with
  `NostrClient.connGeneration`, a per-url counter bumped synchronously inside
  every relay's `onclose`; `refreshAuth` captures it before its
  `relay.auth()` round trip and discards a stale result, success or failure.
  (This only starts to matter once the point above is fixed — before that,
  `refreshAuth` returned early and never reached `relay.auth` at all.)
  Note that nostr-tools' own AUTH auto-trigger rethrows when an auth attempt
  fails with anything but `SendingOnClosedConnection`, which produces an
  unrelated, genuine unhandled-rejection console warning on this same
  interrupted-AUTH path — real, harmless, and deliberately swallowed by
  `src/nostr/client.reconnect.test.ts` rather than treated as a bug.
- **nostr-tools closes an idle relay by itself, and `ongoingOperations` (the
  counter it decides "idle" from) is unreliable.** `AbstractSimplePool`
  defaults `idleTimeout` to 20s and passes it to every `AbstractRelay` it
  creates; once `ongoingOperations` hits 0, `scheduleIdleClose` arms a timer
  that calls `relay.close()` if it is still 0 after that.
  `Subscription.close()` decrements `ongoingOperations` unconditionally,
  with no guard against being called twice — so closing a subscription the
  relay had *already* sent `CLOSED` for (e.g. `auth-required` on a private
  group's content, the normal state right after logout) decrements it a second
  time. `SpaceStore.start()` closes every previous round's subscriptions
  whenever it rebuilds, whether or not the relay already killed one of them —
  that is the second decrement in practice. The counter drifts below the
  number of subscriptions genuinely still open (observed as low as -2) and
  passes through exactly 0 even while a real one (the group-state
  subscription, which the relay never closes, just silently filters — see the
  `pool.get` entry above) is still live. 20s later the connection closes
  itself client-side, `NostrClient`'s own reconnect-on-close brings it back,
  the same subscriptions get rejected again, and it repeats every ~20-80s.
  Found 2026-09-11 as a third cause of CON-35 (an initial theory blamed 3-of-4
  subscriptions being rejected for reaching `ongoingOperations === 0`
  directly — verified false, that alone leaves it at 1; the double-decrement
  is what gets it there). We own this connection's lifecycle ourselves via
  `want()`/`wanted`, so nostr-tools' idle-management only fights that —
  fixed by `pool.idleTimeout = 0` right after construction
  (`SimplePool`'s constructor type does not expose it, but it is a plain
  public field on `AbstractSimplePool`).
- **`NostrClient.want(url)` has more than one caller for the same relay at
  once, and a `Set` cannot tell them apart.** `AppShell`'s `Shell` holds
  the main relay for the whole session; `ProfileSettings`
  (`/settings/profile`) holds the same url again for as long as that page is
  open — and the app's only Sign out button lives there and navigates away
  right after, which unmounts it. With `wanted` as a `Set<string>`, that
  unmount's cleanup did `wanted.delete(url)` and removed the *only* record of
  anyone wanting the relay — including `Shell`'s still-live hold. Every later
  `open()`/`scheduleRetry` call then bails at its `wanted` check, so
  nothing reconnects when the connection eventually drops for any reason; only
  a full reload recovers. Found 2026-09-11 as CON-35's actual, deterministic
  cause: logging out is the only thing in the app that unmounts a second
  `want()` holder, which is why logging in never showed it and three earlier
  fixes (real bugs, but not this one) did not touch it. Fixed by making
  `wanted` a `Map<string, number>` reference count — `want()` increments,
  the returned release decrements and only actually removes the entry (and
  stops retrying) at zero, and a second release is a no-op (React can run the
  same cleanup twice under StrictMode). No client.ts-only test could have found
  this, since none had more than one `want()` holder; guarded by
  `src/nostr/relay-status.test.tsx`, which mounts two `useRelay()`
  consumers under one stable parent and unmounts only the child.
- **`pool.close(url)` during an in-flight `pool.ensureRelay(url)` for the
  same url corrupts the pool, permanently.** `AbstractRelay.close()`
  synchronously nulls `ws.onopen`/`onerror`/`onclose` — the handlers that
  would resolve or reject the `connect()` promise a concurrent
  `ensureRelay()` call is still awaiting. That call then hangs until its own
  `connectionTimeout`, and its catch block does `this.relays.delete(url)` —
  on whatever relay object is registered for that url *by then*, which by then
  can be a different, perfectly healthy connection a second, later
  `ensureRelay()` already finished setting up. That orphans the healthy
  connection from the pool's registry and, in `NostrClient`, flips the UI to
  "offline" with a retry loop that never recovers — only a page reload resets
  the module-level state. Found 2026-09-11 as a further cause of CON-35
  (relay breaks after logout→login, needs a reload): `setSigner` calls
  `pool.close([url])` and then reconnects for every wanted url, and a second
  `setSigner` shortly after the first — any logout immediately followed by
  login — raced its `pool.close` against the first call's still-pending
  `ensureRelay`. CON-30's rewrite covers it by bounding every `ensureRelay`
  (`withTimeout`) and tagging each open attempt with a sequence number, so a
  superseded attempt returns silently instead of deleting whatever the pool
  holds; the earlier per-url serialization of `open()` is gone with it.
