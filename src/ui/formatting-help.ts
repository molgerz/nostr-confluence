/**
 * What can be typed, for whoever does not already know — the content of the
 * `Formatting` fold under the editor (`src/ui/PageEditor.tsx`).
 *
 * It is its own module so it can be tested. Every line here has to be something
 * that actually works when it is typed: the fold is read at the moment somebody
 * is asking "why did that not do anything", so an entry that is almost right —
 * `- []`, which gives a bullet followed by a literal `[]` — costs more than no
 * entry would. `formatting-help.test.ts` types each one into a real editor and
 * checks it draws what it claims. docs/13-editing.md
