# 13 — Writing: one mode, not two

**Decision:** the editor has no Write/Preview switch, because there is nothing
to switch between. The text is drawn the way it will be read while it is being
typed. Typing `# ` and a space sizes the line as a heading on the spot; `- `
turns into a bullet; `**bold**` goes bold. The Markdown markers are only
visible on the line the cursor is on.

**Why:** this is the thing a rich-text wiki gets right that a Markdown box does
not.
Somebody who does not know Markdown never has to hold two representations in
their head — "what I typed" and "what it will look like" — and never has to
click something to find out which is which. And somebody who does know Markdown
loses nothing: it is still Markdown all the way down.

**Non-goal:** a rich-text editor with a Markdown serialiser (TipTap,
ProseMirror). The document has to *be* Markdown, not be convertible to it —
[05](05-versioning-history.md) builds the revision chain, the line diff, blame
and the three-way merge directly on the stored text. A WYSIWYG tree that is
serialised on save would reformat lines nobody touched, and every such
reformatting turns into a diff hunk and a merge conflict. So the editor is the
source, decorated: `src/ui/markdown-live.ts` is a CodeMirror decoration layer,
not a document model.

## The one rule: the active line shows its markup

The line the cursor is on is source; every other line is the result.

```
# Release notes        ← cursor elsewhere: large, no hash
Everything about …
```
```
# Release notes        ← cursor on this line: the # is back, in grey
Everything about …
```

**Why per line and not per construct:** revealing "the markers of whatever my
cursor is inside" is what Obsidian does, and it means the markers of a bold word
appear and disappear as the cursor crosses it. One rule about lines is a rule a
reader works out in the first minute without being told.

Two deliberate exceptions:

- **A mention chip never falls back to raw text.** A 63-character npub in the
  middle of a sentence is not something anyone edits by hand, so it stays a
  chip and is *atomic* instead: one Backspace removes the whole mention. See
  below.
- **An image stays as written** — `![alt](url)`. Drawn as its alt text alone it
  would look like a paragraph that had lost its picture.

The indentation of a nested list item is markup too, so the active line shows
it again — the item shifts by the two spaces it is written with, the way a
heading shifts by its `#`.

## What is recognised

Everything below is standard Markdown — nothing here is a private dialect, so
the same text renders in any Nostr client that knows Markdown.

### Headings

| Type | Result |
|---|---|
| `# ` | H1 |
| `## ` | H2 |
| `### ` | H3 |
| `#### ` | H4 |
| `##### ` | H5 |
| `###### ` | H6 |

H5 and H6 are drawn small, bold and uppercase rather than smaller than body
text, which is what the reading view does too — see `PAGE` in
`src/ui/Markdown.tsx`.

A Setext heading (`Title` with `=====` under it) is sized as a heading as well,
but its underline stays visible: hiding it would leave an empty line behind.

### Lists

| Type | Result |
|---|---|
| `- ` or `* ` | Bullet list. The marker is drawn as `•`, one nesting level in as `◦`, deeper as `▪` |
| `1. ` | Numbered list. The number is **never** replaced, only toned down — a number carries information |
| `- [] ` or `- [ ] ` | Task list with a real checkbox. Clicking it writes `[x]` into the text |

**The indent is a step, not the spaces in the source.** A level is 1.5rem —
the `pl-6` a list gets in `src/ui/Markdown.tsx` — and the marker sits in the
gutter that step opens up, so a wrapped line lines up under the text. The two
spaces that nest an item in the source are markup like any other marker and go
away with it; drawn as they are written, a level would be four pixels instead
of a step and a list would be indented differently here than on the page. The
same goes for the marker itself: it is replaced together with the space behind
it, so the gap to the text is the width of the gutter and not a character.

`Enter` continues a list and a quote, and on an empty item it removes the marker
instead of nesting another one — one press, whether the item is a bullet, a
number or a task.

That last part is `continueList` in `src/ui/MarkdownEditor.tsx`, bound above the
Enter the Markdown language brings. The language uses the same command but with
its default `nonTightLists`, and on the empty item of a list that still has only
one entry that default does not remove the marker: it inserts a blank line and
writes the marker again, because a blank line inside a list is what makes the
list *loose* in CommonMark, and the command keeps that option open. The marker
then only goes on the press after that — and only in the one-entry case, so the
key behaves differently depending on how much has been typed already, which is
not something anybody can learn. Ending the list wins over keeping it loose: a
list is written tight, and the empty line, if it is really wanted, is one
keystroke away afterwards.

The same rule cuts the other way when a list is already *loose* — has a blank
line in it. There the command puts a blank line in front of every new item to
keep it loose, so the cursor lands two lines down with an empty one above it.
That is not configurable, so `continueList` takes the blank line out again. One
rule underneath both halves: **an empty line is something the writer types,
never something a key leaves behind.** And since the first half is what made
lists loose by accident to begin with, the two are the same fix.

A quote still takes two presses: an empty quoted line is a paragraph break
inside the quote, which is a thing people want, so it is only the second one in
a row that ends the quote. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` indent and outdent, **but
only inside a list**: everywhere else `Tab` has to keep moving focus out of the
editor, or the page cannot be operated from the keyboard at all.

### Text

| Type | Result | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `**text**` or `__text__` | **bold** | ⌘B / Ctrl-B |
| `*text*` or `_text_` | *italic* | ⌘I / Ctrl-I |
| `~~text~~` | struck through | ⌘⇧X |
| `` `code` `` | inline code | ⌘E |

The keys toggle: pressing ⌘B on already-bold text removes the markers rather
than nesting a second pair. With nothing selected the cursor lands between the
markers, ready for the word.

### Blocks

| Type | Result |
|---|---|
| `> ` | Quote — a rule down the left, the text in the muted colour |
| ` ``` ` | Code block. The fence goes away off the active line, the **language stays visible** — that is information, not markup |
| `---` or `___` | Divider, drawn as a rule across the measure |

**Trap:** `---` directly under a line of text is not a divider in Markdown, it
is a Setext H2 for the line above. A divider needs a blank line above it. The
editor does not fight this — it shows what the text actually means.

Code inside a fence is coloured, but by a small style bound to the theme tokens
(`codeHighlight` in `src/ui/MarkdownEditor.tsx`), not by CodeMirror's default
highlight style. That default also colours headings and bold text, which would
be a second answer to a question the decorations have already answered.

### Mentions — `@`

Typing `@` at the start of a word opens a list of the people in the space
(admins and members from `39001`/`39002`, via `spacePeople` in
`src/domain/group-state.ts`).

**Decision:** what is written into the text is the key, not the name — a NIP-27
`nostr:npub1…` URI. What is *shown*, in the editor and in the rendered page, is
the name.

**Why:** a display name is freely chosen, not unique and can change. `@alice`
in a stored page would point at whoever calls themselves alice on the day it is
read. The key cannot drift.

This is the one place the app shows a display name without the npub next to it,
which [06](06-ui-information-architecture.md) otherwise forbids. It is
deliberate: a mention sits inside a sentence, and `npub1qz…7k4f` mid-sentence is
unreadable. The key stays one hover away (`title`), the chip's shape says it
stands for a person, and — unlike a byline — a mention is not a claim about who
signed anything.

The dropdown lists the name **with** the shortened npub beside it, because that
is the moment somebody picks between two people. Until a profile has arrived
from `VITE_PROFILE_RELAYS` an entry can only be searched for by its npub;
picking it still works and the chip fills in the name when the profile lands.

Every mentioned key is also written as a `p` tag on the revision and on
comments, as NIP-27 asks — otherwise the mention is findable by whoever reads
the page but not by the person mentioned. See [02](02-data-model-events.md).

### Emoji — `:`

`:` plus at least one letter opens a dropdown that leads with the character
itself, because that is what is being chosen. Picking one inserts **the
character**, not the shortcode: the page then needs no emoji support to render
it and it survives every foreign client.

The list is a curated few hundred entries in `src/ui/emoji.ts`, not an emoji
database — the point is that `:smi` finds 😄 without a keyboard shortcut, and
for that a hand-ordered list beats 3800 entries that have to be downloaded
first. Ranking is exact name, then prefix, then substring, then keyword, so
`:ear` offers `earth_africa` before `bear`.

A lone `:` opens nothing. `:` is punctuation far more often than it is the start
of an emoji, and the boundary guard also keeps the dropdown out of `https://`
and out of `12:30`.

## Why the write and read views must not drift

The sizes in `editorTheme` (`src/ui/MarkdownEditor.tsx`) mirror `PAGE` in
`src/ui/Markdown.tsx` — 17px body at 1.75, the same heading scale, the same
70-character measure. They are two implementations of one scale, because one is
CSS-in-JS for CodeMirror and the other Tailwind classes for React.

**Consequence:** changing one means changing the other. If they drift, writing
and reading stop looking alike, and that is the only thing this whole file is
for. Both places carry a comment saying so.

The editor also grows with its text instead of scrolling inside a 60vh box: a
page is a document, and a document does not have a window in it.

### Empty lines

Markdown collapses them: `a`, three empty lines, `b` parses to exactly the same
document as `a`, one empty line, `b`. The editor, though, draws the source — so
there the three lines *are* three lines, and a page that renders one of them
looks nothing like what was written.

So the gap is read back off the positions the parser recorded and put in as
height, by `rehypeBlankLines` in `src/ui/markdown-blank-lines.ts`. The rule:

- the **first** empty line separates the two paragraphs. That separation is the
  page's own rhythm — 0.9em, not a line — and it is not drawn as one;
- **every further** empty line is one the writer put there on purpose and is
  kept, at exactly the height it has in the editor;
- **before the first block** there is nothing to separate, so every empty line
  counts;
- **after the last block** they are dropped. Trailing empty lines are where the
  cursor was left, not something anybody typed.

The plugin runs *after* `rehype-sanitize`, on purpose: the spacer carries a
`style`, which is exactly the sort of attribute the schema strips. Running
afterwards keeps the check on the author's content strict while ours, which is
not the author's, gets through. Top level only — an empty line inside a
blockquote or a list item is not a paragraph break.

## Formatting help, folded away

There is a `Formatting` disclosure under the editor listing every shortcut
above. It is folded, and it is not a toolbar.

It is deliberately **the same row as "Write a comment"** under a page, in the
same place: a rule, the same gap below it, the same muted 14px line with an
icon in front, and flush with the bottom of the column rather than floating
right under the text. That last part is `PageFrame`'s `stretch` prop — the
frame becomes a flex column and the editor takes what is left, exactly the way
the reading view grows its content so the comment composer lands at the foot of
a short page.

The room this opens under the last line is not dead: clicking it puts the
cursor at the end of the document, the way clicking under the last paragraph of
a document does.

**Opening the fold scrolls it into view.** On a short page it needs no help —
the editor gives the room back, because `flex-1` lets it shrink down to its
text. On a long one it cannot, so the content would appear below the viewport
and nothing would move. The block therefore calls `scrollIntoView` with
`block: 'nearest'`, which scrolls the least it can: the long-page case comes up
into view, the short-page case stays put instead of jumping.

The comment composer on a published page has the same problem and the same
answer — see [06](06-ui-information-architecture.md). Both are the one fold at
the foot of the column, so both had better behave the same way.

Both rows play the same part — the one quiet thing at the foot of the column
that opens when asked — so they should not be two different shapes. The arrow is
the page tree's `ChevronRight`/`ChevronDown`, so that a fold looks like a fold
everywhere in the app.

**Why not a toolbar:** a toolbar puts the technical vocabulary back on screen
permanently, which is exactly what the live formatting removes. The help is
there for the second question — "how do I get a quote?" — not the first one.

## Open

- **`/` at the start of a line → insert menu.** A wiki usually opens a menu for
  tables, images and layouts there. Not built. This is also where
  attachments should come back: since the editor was stripped to title +
  Markdown ([10](10-roadmap.md), phase 6) the Blossom upload in
  `src/nostr/blossom.ts` has no way in except drag & drop.
- **Tables.** Rendered ([`Markdown.tsx`](../src/ui/Markdown.tsx) handles GFM
  tables, wide ones scroll), but there is no help writing one — a pipe table is
  the one piece of Markdown syntax that really is hard to type by hand, and
  doing it properly means column-aware editing, which belongs with the insert
  menu.
- **Auto-replacing a typed-out `:smile:`.** Only the dropdown converts a
  shortcode today. Doing it on the text as well risks firing inside things like
  `a:b:c`, so it waits for a reason.
- **Real-time collaboration.** Unchanged from [05](05-versioning-history.md):
  two people editing at once are resolved by the optimistic lock and the
  three-way merge, not by a CRDT.
