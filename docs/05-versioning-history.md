# 05 — Versioning & working together

## The model: Git semantics in Nostr events

A revision is a commit:

| Git | Here |
|---|---|
| Commit hash | Event `id` (a hash over the event) |
| Author | `pubkey` → npub, **cryptographic, not claimed** |
| Timestamp | `created_at` |
| Parent commit | Tag `parent-rev` |
| Commit message | Tag `summary` |
| Blob | `content` (complete Markdown snapshot) |
| Branch head | Leaf of the chain |
| Merge commit | Revision with two `parent-rev` tags |

The chain is therefore verifiable: order comes from `parent-rev`, not from the
relay's timestamp. A relay can withhold events, but it cannot claim a false
order and cannot invent someone else's authorship.

```
rev1 (alice) ──► rev2 (bob) ──► rev3 (carol)   ← head
                     │
                     └──► rev2b (dave)          ← fork, unresolved conflict
```

## Saving with an optimistic lock

Confluence says "this page was changed in the meantime". That is exactly what we
need, because concurrent editing loses text otherwise.

1. The editor opens the page on base `base = <head id>`.
2. On "save": fetch the head from the relay again.
3. `head == base` → publish a revision with `parent-rev = base`. Done.
4. `head != base` → **three-way merge**, and without a dialog: the app merges,
   writes the result into the editor and explains above it what happened.
   Nothing is published in the process.
   - If the changes do not touch each other, the finished result is right there
     and only needs to be reviewed and saved again.
   - If they overlap, conflict markers sit in the text and saving stays blocked
     until they are removed.
5. The result of a resolution is a merge revision with two `parent-rev` tags.

**Solved differently than planned:** there is no dialog with three buttons and
no "save as a fork" option. A dialog would ask for a decision before you can see
the result; this way you see the merged text first and decide based on it. A
fork still *comes into being* when two people publish at the same time — it can
be resolved via "merge versions" on the page.

**Decision:** no silent overwrite. If the head has moved, we always ask.

## The history view

One timeline per page, newest first:

```
● 11:40  carol   "added a deployment section"      [diff] [restore]
● 11:15  bob     "typo"                            [diff] [restore]
● 10:02  alice   created the page                  [diff]
```

Every entry shows an avatar and display name from `kind 0` with the shortened
npub next to it. The npub is the truth, the display name is only convenience —
the UI makes that visible (name in grey, npub in monospace beside it) so that
two people with the same display name cannot be confused.

Features:

- **Diff** — pick two revisions, line diff with word-level highlighting
  (`jsdiff`). Because every revision is a full-text snapshot, any pair can be
  compared, not just neighbours.
- **Blame** — line-by-line attribution: for each line the most recent revision
  that introduced it, plus its npub. Computed client-side from the chain.
- **Restore** — publishes a *new* revision with the old content,
  `parent-rev = current head`, plus the tag `restore-of = <old id>`. Nothing is
  deleted; the history stays append-only.
- **Verify signature** — the detail view of a revision shows the event id, the
  signature status and the `content-hash`. This is the point where "bound to an
  npub" becomes checkable for users instead of merely asserted.

## Deleting

- **Implemented:** an admin deletes an event via NIP-29 `kind 9005`; the group
  relay enforces it. Applies to revisions and comments, with a confirmation
  prompt in the UI.
- **Open:** a user deleting their *own* revision via NIP-09 `kind 5` — a
  *request* to relays, to be phrased in the UI as "request deletion".
- **Open:** hiding a whole page — a new revision with a tombstone tag plus
  `9005` on the predecessors, so that sidebar and search leave it out.

## Relationship to ngit / NIP-34

ngit was the original inspiration — the Git-over-Nostr stack: NIP-34 with
`30617` repo announcements, `1617` patches, `1621` issues. Two routes:

| Route | Upside | Downside |
|---|---|---|
| **A: our own revision chain (`1818`)** — chosen | Tailored to wiki pages, one event = one readable page, no Git repo needed | No tooling ecosystem, an application-specific kind |
| B: NIP-34 patches (`1617`) | Compatible with ngit/gitworkshop, real diffs, merge requests already exist | Reading a page requires replaying patches; the repo concept fits "space with 200 pages" poorly |

**Decision:** route A for the MVP, because it keeps reading down to a single
event fetch. The Git properties that matter here (authorship by npub, parent
chaining, diff, blame, merge) are fully provided by route A. A NIP-34 export
remains possible as a later feature.

## Real-time collaboration (phase 6)

For simultaneous typing: a CRDT (Yjs or Loro) transported over ephemeral events
(`20000`–`29999`) scoped to the group's `h` — relays do not store those. On save
the CRDT state is committed as a normal `1818` revision. That keeps the history
clean (one revision per save), and live cursors become an addition rather than a
change to the data model.

**Non-goal for the MVP** — deliberately later, because the conflict model in
step 4 already works without a CRDT.
