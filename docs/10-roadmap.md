# 10 — Roadmap

Every phase ends with a verifiable result. The order is chosen so that risk
surfaces early: relay and permissions first, comfort later.

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅ (2026-09-07)
- Vite/React/TS project, Tailwind, routing skeleton
- **Theme tokens and a system/light/dark switch** ([12](12-theming.md)) —
  deliberately first, because retrofitting means touching every component again
- A development relay ([08](08-relay-setup.md))
- `src/nostr/kinds.ts` with all kinds from [02](02-data-model-events.md)
- **Done when:** the app connects, the relay status is displayed, and both modes
  look right in every view that exists

Completed and verified:

| Building block | Location |
|---|---|
| Vite + React 19 + TS, routing per [06](06-ui-information-architecture.md) | `src/routes/router.tsx` |
| Light/dark theme tokens, `@theme inline` | `src/index.css` |
| System/light/dark switch with persistence | `src/theme/theme.tsx`, `src/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx` |
| No flash on load | Inline script in `index.html` |
| All kinds and tags in one place, slug normalisation | `src/nostr/kinds.ts` |
| Parsing the group address `host'id` | `src/nostr/group-address.ts` |
| Relay connection + NIP-11 + backoff | `src/nostr/relay-status.ts` |
| Confluence layout: top bar, sidebar, content, right rail | `src/ui/layout/` |
| Tasks `relay`, `seed`, `dev`, `check` | `justfile` |

Verified in the browser: light/dark switching in every view, persistence across
a reload (`data-theme` and the toggle state survive), the relay status showing
"connected" with the relay's name, and the offline state with a reconnect
counter after stopping the relay.

## Phase 1 — Sign-in (requirement 1) ✅ (2026-09-07)
- NIP-07 detection, `getPublicKey`, profile (`kind 0`), session
- NIP-42 AUTH including an automatic retry after reconnect
- A signer interface (for NIP-46 later)
- **Done when:** signing in with Alby works and a publish after a reconnect does
  not fail silently

Completed and verified:

| Building block | Location |
|---|---|
| Signer interface, `window.nostr` detection with polling | `src/nostr/signer.ts` |
| Relay layer with NIP-42: sign the challenge automatically, retry publish after `auth-required`, backoff reconnect | `src/nostr/client.ts` |
| Session, profile from kind 0, detecting an account switch before writing | `src/session/session.tsx` |
| Sign-in button, account chip, failure strip, write probe | `src/ui/SignInButton.tsx`, `src/ui/UserChip.tsx`, `src/ui/SessionNotice.tsx`, `src/ui/WriteCheck.tsx` |
| Throwaway signer for automated tests without an extension (DEV only, only with `?devsigner`) | `src/dev/fake-nip07.ts` |

Library decision from the spike: **nostr-tools**, not NDK — see
[07](07-tech-stack.md).

Cross-checked against the real NIP-29 relay (`groups_relay`,
ws://localhost:8080): signing in, session across a reload, and a write probe
that the relay confirmed as accepted and delivered back through our own
subscription.

Three findings that would not have surfaced without testing:
- `pool.get` takes no `onauth` hook. On a relay with enforced NIP-42 it
  therefore returns empty results silently. Reading now goes through
  `subscribeEose` with `onauth`.
- Ephemeral events need a subscriber, otherwise the relay rejects them. The
  write probe therefore subscribes first and waits for its own event.
- `subscribeEose` closes the subscription on EOSE. That is too early for the
  echo of an ephemeral event — there `pool.subscribe` plus manual closing is
  needed.

## Phase 2 — Space & sidebar (requirement 2) ✅ (2026-09-07)
- Load groups (`39000`–`39002`), space header, member list
- Left bar with fixed entries
- Page tree, routing complete
- **Done when:** a space created by the seed script is fully navigable

Implemented in `src/nostr/space-store.ts` (one store per space, holding the
relay events and deriving pages and tree) and `src/domain/group-state.ts`. The
overview shows name, description, the flags from `39000`, members from `39002`
and roles from `39001`, plus an "you are admin/member" badge.

## Phase 3 — Reading and creating pages (requirement 3) ✅ (2026-09-07)
- Publish `1818` revisions (the first revision creates the page)
- Head resolution, Markdown rendering with sanitising
- Page tree from revisions, slug normalisation
- Editor with preview and a `summary` field
- **Done when:** two browser profiles see each other's pages

| Building block | Location |
|---|---|
| Reading revisions from events, checking the h tag | `src/domain/revision.ts` |
| Head resolution over `parent-rev`, leaves, page tree | `src/domain/pages.ts` |
| Signing and publishing a revision (with `content-hash`) | `src/nostr/publish-page.ts` |
| Rendering Markdown with `rehype-sanitize` | `src/ui/Markdown.tsx` |
| Editor for new and existing pages | `src/ui/PageEditor.tsx` |
| Page, history, overview, sidebar tree | `src/routes/`, `src/ui/layout/Sidebar.tsx` |

Verified against the running NIP-29 relay: created the page "Deployment" as a
subpage of "Handbook", then edited it — the second revision points at the first
via `parent-rev`, the history lists both with npub and note, and the sidebar
tree nests the page under its parent.

**Deviation since resolved:** the editor started out as a plain textarea; since
phase 6 it is CodeMirror 6 with Markdown highlighting.

Fork detection from phase 4 is already present as a display: if a page has more
than one leaf, both the page and the sidebar show it. Merging came later.

## Phase 4 — Editing together (requirements 4 & 6) ✅ (2026-09-07)
- Joining: use auto-join in `open` groups, `9021` fallback for stricter relays
- Optimistic lock: check the head before publishing
- Three-way merge, fork banner, merge revision
- **Done when:** concurrent editing loses no text and the conflict is visible

| Building block | Location |
|---|---|
| Line-based three-way merge with conflict markers | `src/domain/merge.ts` |
| Most recent common ancestor of two revisions | `findCommonAncestor` in `src/domain/pages.ts` |
| Optimistic lock and merge in the editor | `src/ui/PageEditor.tsx` |
| Merging a forked page | `src/routes/EditorView.tsx` with `?merge=1` |

What happens on save: if the head of the chain has moved since the editor was
opened, nothing is published — the versions are merged and a human is asked. If
the changes overlap, conflict markers sit in the text and saving stays blocked
until they are gone. The result of a merge is a revision with two `parent-rev`
tags.

Played through against the running relay: two competing revisions created via
`nak`, merged in the app (merge revision `bc523a4b` with both predecessors),
then a foreign revision published while the editor was open — on save the app
merged instead of overwriting, marked the conflict and refused to save until the
markers were removed.

Two bugs found in the process: line numbers from unified-diff hunks are
ambiguous for pure insertions (an inserted section landed one line too far
down) — change detection now runs over `diffArrays` on line arrays. And the
merge started as soon as two leaves had loaded while the common base was still
in flight; the editor now waits for the load to complete.

## Phase 5 — History (requirement 5) ✅ (2026-09-07)
- Timeline per page with npub, time and `summary`
- Diff between arbitrary revisions, blame per line
- Restore as a new revision, signature detail view
- **Done when:** every version of a page is attributable to an npub and
  verifiable

| Building block | Location |
|---|---|
| Line diff with line numbers for both sides, folding long unchanged runs | `src/domain/diff.ts`, `src/ui/DiffView.tsx` |
| Line origin across the chain | `src/domain/blame.ts`, `src/routes/BlameView.tsx` |
| Comparing arbitrary revisions, details, restore | `src/routes/HistoryView.tsx` |

Comparison works between **arbitrary** revisions, not just neighbours —
possible because every revision carries a full-text snapshot. Additions and
removals are marked with `+` and `−` as well, not by colour alone.

Restoring deletes nothing: a new revision is created with the old content,
pointing at its template via `restore-of` and at the current head as its
predecessor.

Played through against the running relay; the chain of the test page shows the
whole arc: root, fork, merge revision with two predecessors, competing revision,
conflict resolution, restore with `restore-of`.

**Known simplification:** line origin follows the first parent. In a merge
revision the lines of the second branch therefore appear as introduced by the
merge — the same behaviour as `git blame` without extra options.

## Phase 6 — Expansion (in progress)

Done:

| Building block | Location |
|---|---|
| Full-text search over titles and content, local instead of NIP-50 | `src/domain/search.ts`, `src/routes/SearchView.tsx` |
| Collapsible sidebar, state preserved | `src/ui/layout/Sidebar.tsx` |
| Comments with threads (kind 1111) | `src/domain/comment.ts`, `src/ui/Comments.tsx` |
| Moderation: add and remove members, delete events | `src/nostr/moderation.ts`, `src/ui/MemberAdmin.tsx` |
| Mobile layout: sidebar as an overlay, compact top bar | `src/ui/layout/AppShell.tsx`, `Topbar.tsx` |
| "On this page" table of contents with anchors | `src/domain/toc.ts`, `src/ui/layout/TableOfContents.tsx` |
| Display names and avatars from kind 0, fetched in batches | `src/nostr/profile-store.ts`, `src/ui/Author.tsx` |
| CodeMirror 6 editor with Markdown highlighting | `src/ui/MarkdownEditor.tsx` |
| Attachments via Blossom, upload by button and drag & drop | `src/nostr/blossom.ts`, `scripts/dev-blossom.mjs` |
| Editing one's own profile (kind 0, NIP-01 fields), foreign fields preserved | `src/nostr/publish-profile.ts`, `src/routes/ProfileSettings.tsx` |
| Reading typography: 16px body, heading scale, 70-character measure, second density for comments | `src/ui/Markdown.tsx` |
| Collapsible branches in the page tree, folded state kept | `src/ui/layout/Sidebar.tsx` |
| Markdown completed: `h4`–`h6`, `hr`, GFM task lists, wide tables scroll | `src/ui/Markdown.tsx` |
| `color-scheme` per mode, so the browser draws controls and scrollbars to match | `src/index.css` |
| `/login` dropped: sign in where the click is, failures in a strip under the top bar | `src/ui/SignInButton.tsx`, `src/ui/SessionNotice.tsx` |

Open: the `30818` interop mirror, sidebar ordering (`30820`), real-time CRDT
(simultaneous typing), NIP-46 sign-in, an editor toolbar.

### Described in the docs but not built yet

As of 2026-09-07, found while comparing the docs against the code:

| Gap | Where it is described |
|---|---|
| IndexedDB cache: instant rendering on reload, offline reading | [01](01-architecture.md), [07](07-tech-stack.md) |
| End-to-end tests (Playwright), including the colour-mode regression | [07](07-tech-stack.md), [12](12-theming.md) |
| `9021` join flow for relays without auto-join | [04](04-permissions-nip29.md) |
| Deleting your own revision (NIP-09 `kind 5`) | [05](05-versioning-history.md) |
| Hiding a whole page (tombstone) | [05](05-versioning-history.md) |
| Writing `previous` timeline references | [02](02-data-model-events.md) |
| Sidebar entries "all pages", "recently changed", "space settings" | [06](06-ui-information-architecture.md) |
| Syntax highlighting when *displaying* code blocks | [07](07-tech-stack.md) |
| Onboarding note that an npub is a permanent pseudonym | [09](09-security-privacy.md) |
| `30818` interop mirror for NIP-54 clients | [02](02-data-model-events.md) |

### Deliberately solved differently than planned

Not a backlog, just a different choice — each justified where the original
decision was made:

| Instead of | Now | Justified in |
|---|---|---|
| Zustand as a state library | our own stores via `useSyncExternalStore` | [07](07-tech-stack.md) |
| MiniSearch | our own search over the loaded pages | [07](07-tech-stack.md) |
| The `diff3` package | our own three-way merge | [07](07-tech-stack.md) |
| A `data/` folder, files `revision-graph.ts`/`tree.ts` | `nostr/space-store.ts`, `domain/pages.ts` | [07](07-tech-stack.md) |
| A session with pubkey **and** timestamp | pubkey only; checked before every write | [03](03-auth-nip07-nip42.md) |
| A merge dialog with three buttons | the merge lands in the editor, the decision is made on the finished text | [05](05-versioning-history.md) |
| A yellow "saved locally only" strip | the editor stays open and shows the relay's reason literally | [06](06-ui-information-architecture.md) |
| A single `--diff-word-bg` token | separate tokens for added and removed | [12](12-theming.md) |

**Also open and required for real use:** the group is so far created entirely
outside the app through `nak` — there is no button to create a space (`9007`),
change its metadata (`9002`) or request to join (`9021`, for relays without
auto-join). On top of that, a relay under its own domain with TLS instead of
`localhost`. See [NOSTR.md](../NOSTR.md), section "Right now".

## Why this order

Requirement 5 (history) comes late even though it matters a lot — because from
phase 3 onwards the data model produces it *automatically*. Every save is
already an immutable, signed revision; phase 5 only builds the view on top. If
history were a feature bolted on afterwards, it would have to come earlier. That
is exactly why the event design is what it is.
